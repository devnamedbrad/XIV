By attuning their aetherial energies to that of constellations, they learned to wield magicks with heretofore unseen properties.Thus was astromancy born―a new form of magick which grants its users power over fate. Employing a star globe and divining deck in their miraculous deeds, fortune always smiles upon these masters of arcana. This magic is highly secretive and for it to leave Sharlayan would result in some problems for all involved.In battle, an Astologian will deal from their deck and scry the stars of their astrosphere to benefit their party.

Though not a strong offensive weapon, a Sage's main goal is to heal their party and provide a barrier so their more armored friends don't get hurt on the frontlines. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20251202190130.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251202190130.png\" target=\"_self\">MIG d6, DEX d8, INS d10, WLP d8\nClasses:\nSpiritist 2 - Spiritual Magic 2 (Heal, Cleanse)\nEsper 2 - Cognitive Focus, Hypercognition\nTinkerer 1 - Inventions (Basic Alchemy)\nItems: Nouliths, Sage RobeCost: 100z\nArcane weapon\nTwo-Handed, Ranged\n[DEX+INS]\n[HR+6] Physical damage","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"History","level":3,"id":"History_0"},{"heading":"Combat style","level":3,"id":"Combat_style_0"},{"heading":"Recommendations","level":3,"id":"Recommendations_0"},{"heading":"Nouliths","level":4,"id":"Nouliths_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"classes/sage.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20251202190130.html"],"createdTime":1764727184821,"modifiedTime":1764727548840,"sourceSize":1543,"sourcePath":"Classes/Sage.md","exportPath":"classes/sage.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":16,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"classes/samurai.html":{"title":"Samurai","icon":"","description":"Far across the rolling waves, towards the rising sun, there lies the island nation of Hingashi. In the distant past, the realm's great lords vied for supremacy over its sea-girt confines in a long and bloody conflict. And taking to battle in their lieges' names were noble swordsmen whose art was forged in the crucible of war: the samurai.Eventually, the nation was unified under one banner, and these warriors came to wield their katana not upon fields as part of an army, but upon streets as protectors of the peace.But as a neglected blade grows dull with rust, so too do men forget their purpose. Amidst waning memories of the old ways, a determined few hold fast to their convictions, hands by katana grips, awaiting the moment for steel to sing. One such wandering Samurai has found his way to Ul'dah, and begun to teach his apprentice the ways of the Hingashi warriors. In battle, a Samurai flows through their movements to slice their enemies quickly, or to block an attack alltogether. Through swift combinatiosn of movements, they mimic their techniques of Snow, Moon and Flower. making their battle a well practiced execution of blade strikes. Some tales speak of sword masters able to strike an entire block of enemies down with one swing. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20251202195948.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251202195948.png\" target=\"_self\">MIG d8, DEX d10, INS d6, WLP d8\nClasses:\nWeaponmaster 3 - Counterattack, Bladestorm, Melee Weapon Mastery\nFury 2 - Withstand 2\nItems: Katana, Travel Garb, 200z","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"History","level":3,"id":"History_0"},{"heading":"Combat style","level":3,"id":"Combat_style_0"},{"heading":"Recommendations","level":3,"id":"Recommendations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"classes/samurai.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20251202195948.html"],"createdTime":1764730750243,"modifiedTime":1764731798348,"sourceSize":1514,"sourcePath":"Classes/Samurai.md","exportPath":"classes/samurai.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":17,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"classes/scholar.html":{"title":"Scholar","icon":"","description":"In an age long past, when mankind flourished under the radiance of arcane mastery, the island of Vylbrand was home to a city-state called Nym.

Using magicked gemstones upon which the selfsame symbols are graven, arcanists are also able to summon forth the ephemeral being Carbuncle to carry out their bidding.In times immemorial, there lived mages who had not only the power to summon the primals, but also the means to transmute the primals' essences, thus binding them to their will. Known simply as summoners, the existence of these men and women and their arcane art have been all but lost to the ages. But with a rise in threats of primals, a young Miqote has sought the aid of a talented Arcanist to try to remake the Summoners. In battle, a Summoner (starting as an Arcanist) provides offensive support to their party by twisting aether into the forms of carbuncles, and gemshined magics. Though the idea of a Summoner today is nearly impossible, the threats of Primals make their study and growing strength a guarantee. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20251202193752.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251202193752.png\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251202193733.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251202193733.png\" target=\"_self\">MIG d6, DEX d6, INS d10, WLP d10\nClasses:\nArcanist 2 - Bind and Summon (Forge Arcanum), Arcane Circle\nWayfarer 3 - Faithful Companion 3 (Create a carbuncle)\nItems: Tome, Sage’s Robe, 200zRuby, Topaz, or Emerald Carbuncle","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"History","level":3,"id":"History_0"},{"heading":"Combat style","level":3,"id":"Combat_style_0"},{"heading":"Recommendations","level":3,"id":"Recommendations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"classes/summoner.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20251202193752.html","images/pasted-image-20251202193733.html"],"createdTime":1764729338651,"modifiedTime":1764729771095,"sourceSize":1564,"sourcePath":"Classes/Summoner.md","exportPath":"classes/summoner.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":19,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"classes/warrior.html":{"title":"Warrior","icon":"","description":"On the northernmost edge of Abalathia's Spine exists a mountain tribe renowned for producing fearsome mercenaries.

to the Enchiridion, the book of holy scripture of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, the Holy See of Ishgard was founded when King Thordan led the Elezen to the promised land of Coerthas. The dragon Nidhogg attacked them, killing the king, but his son, Haldrath, took the wyrm's eye and forced him to retreat.

These two deities came to quarrel over which should rule the new world, and created mortals to serve in their war by proxy. These were the first Au Ra—the Raen, children of the Dawn Father, and the Xaela, the chosen of the Dusk Mother.Believing themselves the children of the Dawn Father, the forebears of the Auri Raen left behind their homeland to settle across Othard. They were received with hatred and hostility in the early years, until a prominent warlord of Yanxia, impressed with their valor, forged an alliance with the strange race and took them on as retainers.No matter where they came to be, with their innate martial prowess, they readily found employment as soldiers and carved out places for themselves within spheres of authority. Before long, the Raen had assumed a prominent role as warriors in service of countless great warlords, and their members spread across the Far East, from the lands of Nagxia and beyond the Ruby Sea to the isles of Hingashi, where they earned a reputation as legendary swordsmen.Among the peoples of the Far East, it is believed that the Au Ra of the Azim Steppe were the first to keep livestock. They initially tamed horses to serve as mounts, and it was this achievement which led to the Au Ra's decisive rise to dominance over the plains. When the Raen subsequently departed their ancestral home, they took with them the knowledge of rearing and riding horses to the lands beyond the Steppe. After the horse, the Au Ra turned their hand to taming the yol, and these new mounts saw them expand their dominion to the skies above the Steppe.The Xaela have to this day not abandoned their ancestral home, living a nomadic life as hunters and gatherers on the vast Azim Steppe. With suitable grazing land sparse, conflict between individual tribes is common, with tribes forming, disbanding, and dying off in a ceaseless cycle of war and bloodshed.Not all Xaela dwell upon the steppes, however. In 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, some among the Xaela who lived in frontier towns of Othard fell under subjugation of the Garlean Empire. When they arrived at last in Eorzea in the year 1562, they found themselves drawn to the plains of Coerthas, and hoped to adopt the nomadic ways of their ancestors, only to be massacred by the people of Ishgard.<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251126161223.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251126161223.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Raen","level":4,"id":"Raen_0"},{"heading":"Xaela","level":4,"id":"Xaela_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"races/au-ra.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20251126161223.html"],"createdTime":1764197955488,"modifiedTime":1764198745161,"sourceSize":2458,"sourcePath":"Races/Au Ra.md","exportPath":"races/au-ra.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":111,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"races/elezen.html":{"title":"Elezen","icon":"","description":"The forests of the Black Shroud have been home to the Wildwood Elezen for centuries.

As such, Gridania and Ishgard have traditionally enjoyed close relations, with each nation coming to the other's aid in times of need.Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and seclusion in the depths of Eorzea's caves and caverns. Today, they are called the Duskwight though to their Wildwood cousins they are known simply as the \"Greys,\" after their preference for darkness and stone.These cave-dwelling Elezen are the descendants of a branch that split from the main Wildwood clan during the founding of Gridania, choosing instead to remain in the stone-hewn chambers of Gelmorra or seek out new subterranean sanctums. The Duskwight despise the \"shackles\" of urban life, and it is not uncommon for them to avoid the city-states altogether.Some even resort to brigandry to survive and, as a result, they are often looked upon with scorn by the citizens of Gridania.

The Helion clan centered their society and daily lives around their queen, who was chosen by favor of the gods. The Hrothgar stuggled against the Allagan Empire in a futile war until the land was brought together under a single queen, who put an end to the war. This first queen was named Gunnhildr.Despite the city of Bozja being reborn, it still suffered from extreme poverty, allowing the Garlean Empire to invade and take control, causing many Hrothgar to flee to the distant shores of Eorzea. After the Bozja Incident many Hrothgar Helions had fled the country to seek lives elsewhere.Order is the guiding principle of Helion culture. With a queen at its center, the community obeys a strict code of conduct, with each member carrying out their assigned roles. A female child is instructed in her duties from birth and, one she comes of age, a segment of the population will break away to form a new community under this new queen. Under certain circumstances, the queen may welcome others from outsider her home clan, including the Lost.The Lost are a distinction of Hrothgar as identified by scholars in the same vein as Helions. However, for one reason or another, The Lost have found themselves bereft of their queen's presence. The techniques of the Gunbreaker are said to be inherited from the Hrothgar from Northern Ilsabard and passed down generations. Their weapons are what the Garlean Empire based theirs on after their invasion and eventual takeover.In contrast to the Helions' well-defined social order, the culture of the Lost is characterized by chaos. As many have lived their entire lives adhering to clear roles and strict laws, the sudden loss of structure must be disorienting at best. Many Lost fully embrace the nomadic lifestyle, committing themselves to the search for new purpose. This may mean exacting vengeance for a slain queen, or seeking to honor their late ruler by carrying out her final wishes.

Their skin tones tend generally toward the fairer, lighter side of the spectrum, though as with many races this is not universal.This inclination toward grasslands and plains naturally led the bulk of Eorzea's Plainsfolk to Vylbrand's wide meadows; it has been strongly implied that they made up a major portion, perhaps the majority, of the population of&nbsp;<a data-href=\"Nym\" href=\"locations/eorzea/vylbrand/nym.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nym</a>, and even today the greater majority of Plainsfolk can be found in and around Limsa Lominsa.

Among them are people who truly want the best for Ul’dah, and others who will sell their own mother for profit. The people of Ul’dah primarily pray to the twin gods <a data-href=\"Nald'thal\" href=\"the-gods/nald'thal.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nald'thal</a>, said to weigh the value of their deeds upon death.<br><a data-href=\"Limsa Lominsa\" href=\"locations/eorzea/vylbrand/limsa-lominsa.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Limsa Lominsa</a>, a thriving and beautiful sea port with vast farmland and expanding port cities along the La Noscean coast.

La Noscea is known for incredible metalworks, ale and of course, vicious warriors who fear neither gale nor foe. The people of Limsa aren’t the most religious, but their naval forces will always pray to <a data-href=\"Llymlaen\" href=\"the-gods/llymlaen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Llymlaen</a>, goddess of the seas, for a safe voyage.<br><a data-href=\"Gridania\" href=\"locations/eorzea/the-black-shroud/gridania.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gridania</a>, a city that is engulfed in the land itself.

Their leader is selected among an incredibly rare group of Hyur, called the Padjal, who act as mediators between the elementals of the Shroud, and the people of their city. Most citizens pray to <a data-href=\"Nophica\" href=\"the-gods/nophica.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nophica</a>, the Matron, for both blessed harvests and protection from evil.<br>The Holy See of <a data-href=\"Ishgard\" href=\"locations/eorzea/coerthas/ishgard.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ishgard</a>, shining city on the mount, overlooking the dominion of Coerthas.

Though once an active member of the old Eorzean Alliance, Ishgard has retreated into its own lands to continue a now 1500 year old war with the Dravanian Horde. Their gates have been all but closed to outsiders, and to some of their own citizens.<br><a data-href=\"Ala Mhigo\" href=\"locations/eorzea/gyr-abania/ala-mhigo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ala Mhigo</a>, a martial nation that was once a force to be reckoned with.

In 1500 their king sought more land from their neighbor Gridania, and were subdued by the first Eorzean Alliance. In 1557, in the midst of a civil war, Ala Mhigo fell to the Garlean Empire. Its people either displaced or made to submit, the now occupied city-state remains a husk of what it once was.&nbsp;<br><a data-href=\"Garlemald\" href=\"locations/ilsabard/garlemald.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Garlemald</a> is, for the most part, a mystery. Though the land was once mapped and had smaller neighboring states, the Empire discovered a fuel they dubbed “ceruleum” and quickly made warmachines their neighbors could not defeat. The Empire has taken over their own island continent of Ilsabard, the eastern continent of Othard, and now part of Eorzea has been brought to heel. It is unknown how their emperor, Solus zos Galvus, united his nation, but under his rule it has grown immensely.&nbsp;After its success in Ala Mhigo, in 1562 the Garlean Empire began encroaching on the western coast of Eorzea to pinch the nations and breach the font of aetheric magic they believed Silvertear Lake to be. Bringing its largest airship, the Agrius, the Garleans hoped to overwhelm the forces of Eorzea. Their plan however was foiled by the awakening of the largest dragon ever seen. It encircled the ship and brought it into Silvertear lake. The ship exploded and a massive surge of aether from within the lake was released into the world. From it came a swelling of power, and rumors of the beast tribes summoning “primals” of eld. The corpses of the Agrius and the great wyrm can be seen to this day, though all avoid the “keeper of the lake”.10 years later we find you, adventurer, starting your life amidst the chaos of what a few people call the start of the Seventh Umbral Era.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The world of
