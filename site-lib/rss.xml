Said to be blessed by the goddess of navigation, Llymlaen, the city is spread out over countless tiny islands, each connected by sturdy bridges of iron and wood construction, earning her the name the "Navigator's Veil" from traveling bards who have witnessed the city's beauty from afar.Limsa Lominsa is a traditional thalassocracy, with power lying in the hands of the ruling party and its leader, <a data-href="Chief Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn" href="people/limsa-lominsa/chief-admiral-merlwyb-bloefhiswyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chief Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn</a>.

Many races call this star home, with nearly as many gods to match. Hydaelyn, named after the highest god, has had a rich history of civilizations and calamities. With each era of strife and death - the Umbral Eras, came a lasting time of peace - the Astral Eras. It is currently the year 1572 of the 6th Astral Era.Our story begins in the collection of lands called Eorzea. There are several city-states on this continent that live in relative peace despite minor border disputes, previous wars, or piracy. In 1500, the first Eorzean Alliance was created, but it did not last long.<br><a data-href="Ul'dah" href="locations/eorzea/thanalan/ul'dah.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ul'dah</a>, shining gem of the deserts of Thanalan.

La Noscea is known for incredible metalworks, ale and of course, vicious warriors who fear neither gale nor foe.

In 1500 their king sought more land from their neighbor Gridania, and were subdued by the first Eorzean Alliance. In 1557, in the midst of a civil war, Ala Mhigo fell to the Garlean Empire. Its people either displaced or made to submit, the now occupied city-state remains a husk of what it once was.&nbsp;<br><a data-href="Garlemald" href="locations/ilsabard/garlemald.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Garlemald</a> is, for the most part, a mystery. Though the land was once mapped and had smaller neighboring states, the Empire discovered a fuel they dubbed “ceruleum” and quickly made warmachines their neighbors could not defeat. The Empire has taken over their own island continent of Ilsabard, the eastern continent of Othard, and now part of Eorzea has been brought to heel. It is unknown how their emperor, Solus zos Galvus, united his nation, but under his rule it has grown immensely.&nbsp;After its success in Ala Mhigo, in 1562 the Garlean Empire began encroaching on the western coast of Eorzea to pinch the nations and breach the font of aetheric magic they believed Silvertear Lake to be. Bringing its largest airship, the Agrius, the Garleans hoped to overwhelm the forces of Eorzea. Their plan however was foiled by the awakening of the largest dragon ever seen. It encircled the ship and brought it into Silvertear lake. The ship exploded and a massive surge of aether from within the lake was released into the world. From it came a swelling of power, and rumors of the beast tribes summoning “primals” of eld. The corpses of the Agrius and the great wyrm can be seen to this day, though all avoid the “keeper of the lake”.10 years later we find you, adventurer, starting your life amidst the chaos of what a few people call the start of the Seventh Umbral Era.]]></description><link>final-fantasy-xiv.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Final Fantasy XIV.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 20:56:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Skatay Range]]></title><description><![CDATA[The&nbsp;Skatay Range&nbsp;is a large, snow capped mountain range that divides&nbsp;Dalmasca and&nbsp;Othard.

These forces, together with an immense standing army equipped with equally imposing arms and armor, grant Garlemald unrivaled military might.

They specialize in the breeding and training of griffins, and those they have raised were much beloved by members of the royal family. As griffins offer their riders an unrivaled degree of mobility and are stalwart allies on the battlefield, they had a central role in Ala Mhigo's beastmaster battalion. In light of their achievements in the raising of griffins, the Vochsteins were made members of the nobility, and though their status paled in comparison with more established houses, they served the nation diligently.So loyal were they to the royal family, that when Garlemald invaded Ala Mhigo, Cairm, the head of the Vochsteins, chose to let free the griffins he and his kin had raised rather than allow them to fall into the hands of the imperials. It is a tragic tale still told by the people of Ala Mhigo to this day. Few Beastmasters exist outside of occupied Ala Mhigo, with the vast majority now serving the Garlean Empire. In battle, a Beast Master will strike with melee weapons and give commands to their beast allies to overwhelm their opponents. Their bond with their animals is that of family, and if the danger is too great they will flee rather than let their family be killed. Though some have tried to use a bow, the vast majority of Beast Masters wield an axe and shield, or in the case of an infamous one, just their fists. <img alt="Pasted image 20251211122023.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251211122023.png" target="_self">MIG d10, DEX d8, INS d6, WLP d8

But can he be trusted, or is he merely a con artist looking to make a quick gil?You took the plunge and purchased a stone. Will your study of monsters and magic produce a combat style unseen in Eorzea before?In battle, a Blue Mage is a versatile role. Blue Mages are a confusing caster, using chaotic and unpredictable attacks to overwhelm those that stand before them, and learn from the magic around them. Through aetheric mimicry, they can adjust their magics to better suit a defensive, offensive, or support role, by copying the magics of the beasts they encounter. <img alt="Pasted image 20251211100726.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251211100726.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d6, INS d10, WLP d10

The dragon Nidhogg attacked them, killing the king, but his son, Haldrath, took the wyrm's eye and forced him to retreat. In the wake of the king's demise, Haldrath refused the crown and became the first Azure Dragoon. The Elezen chose to put power in faith, annointing an archbishop as sovereign of their new nation with the remaining knights founding the four High Houses of Ishgard.Ishgard's banner displays the crests of the four High Houses on an escutcheon and the winged crown on top represents the archbishop. The city-state's motto, "Of the Sky, From the Sky, For the Sky", is featured beneath the sigils.

A Thavnairian troupe has made it's way to Limsa Lominsa, taking on a new local apprentice.In battle, a Dancer will weave the magics that inspire, while effortlessly throwing their chakram around the field. Though their dance may be improvised the movements at their core are a practiced martial arrangement. Usually working in pairs, a dancer will pick a partner in their groups to match their dance to, and in turn strengthen their partner.<img alt="Pasted image 20251203122209.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251203122209.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d10, INS d10, WLP d6

In time, their impassioned songs came to hold sway over the hearts of men, inspiring their comrades to great feats and granting peace unto those who lay upon the precipice of death. The God's Quiver archers of Gridania have seen the arrival of new Bards, and the start of a new segment of their army.In battle, a Bard will distance themselves to shoot an enemy from afar while providing songs to boost the strength of their party.

Held within special grimoires, these symbols lend shape to the arcanist's aether, thereby allowing them to produce a myriad of powerful spells. Using magicked gemstones upon which the selfsame symbols are graven, arcanists are also able to summon forth the ephemeral being Carbuncle to carry out their bidding.In times immemorial, there lived mages who had not only the power to summon the primals, but also the means to transmute the primals' essences, thus binding them to their will. Known simply as summoners, the existence of these men and women and their arcane art have been all but lost to the ages. But with a rise in threats of primals, a young Miqote has sought the aid of a talented Arcanist to try to remake the Summoners. In battle, a Summoner (starting as an Arcanist) provides offensive support to their party by twisting aether into the forms of carbuncles, and gemshined magics. Though the idea of a Summoner today is nearly impossible, the threats of Primals make their study and growing strength a guarantee. <img alt="Pasted image 20251202193752.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202193752.png" target="_self"><img alt="Pasted image 20251202193733.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202193733.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d6, INS d10, WLP d10

Though the history of that age tells of countless wars waged with earth-shattering incantations, it was the brilliant strategic maneuvering of Nym's scholars that allowed their mundane army of mariners to throw back would-be conquerors time and again. These learned men and women defended the freedom of their tiny nation with their unique command over spell-weaving faeries, utilizing the creatures' magicks to heal the wounded and bolster the strength of their allies. Though in modern times, scholars are non existent, except one Arcanist who found a soul crystal while working with a Marauder in Limsa Lominsa.In battle, a Scholar is meant to lead and heal their party. Though pre-emptive shields, or using their fairy companion to soothe ailments. Accomplished Arcanists on their own, they can still present an offensive spell or two, while their fairies are purely for healing. The soul crystal they have whispers of ages long past, and it is unknown if there could be more scholars somewhere. <img alt="Pasted image 20251202185235.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202185235.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d8, INS d10, WLP d8

Thus did he labor to master the skill of foresight―but initial efforts bore little fruit. That is, until he looked to the stars above, which foretell the coming seasons, and learned to read the heavens.Though this gift is known today as astrology, the people of Sharlayan saw fit to not only read the stars, but to write their movements as well. By attuning their aetherial energies to that of constellations, they learned to wield magicks with heretofore unseen properties.Thus was astromancy born―a new form of magick which grants its users power over fate. Employing a star globe and divining deck in their miraculous deeds, fortune always smiles upon these masters of arcana. This magic is highly secretive and for it to leave Sharlayan would result in some problems for all involved.In battle, an Astologian will deal from their deck and scry the stars of their astrosphere to benefit their party. Using their magic to turn back time from damage, or using the right constellation to buff their friends.

Through practiced meditation on the essences of creation, conjurers draw forth and absorb aether from their immediate surroundings. Taught by the Padjal, the Conjurers of Gridania work to bring elemental harmony to their homeland.White magic, the arcane art of succor, was conceived eras past that the world might know comfort. Alas, man began perverting its powers for self-gain, and by his wickedness brought about the Sixth Umbral catastrophe. Although the art subsequently became forbidden, it is now in the midst of a revival at the hands of the Padjal, and this incredible one chosen by the elementals. In battle, a White Mage will work to protect their comrades through healing magics and barriers. Though not purely meant to heal, they can assail enemies with the nature around them, lobbing large stones at unsuspecting creatures. A White Mage's duty is to keep their party alive, and tales of old Amdapor speak of those who may have beaten death a time or two. <img alt="Pasted image 20251202144946.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202144946.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d8, INS d8, WLP d10

The weapon itself combines a sword with a firing mechanism, emitting a range of magical effects by utilizing aetherically imbued cartridges. Originally employed by Queen Gunnhildr's personal guard, they were once known as "Gunnhildr's Blades."Unlike the models used by the Garlean Empire, the gunbreaker's gunblades fire aetherically-charged bullets, full of soil, into the blade to enhance their cutting power and the force of their strikes. When fired normally, the powder coalesces into a defensive barrier that can protect the wielder and their allies from harm. In battle, a Gunbreaker will make use of their aetherically charged ammo to infuse their their strikes. From strengthening an attack, causing an explosion, or in some cases creating a barrier for those nearby, a Gunbreaker is a reactive bodyguard.

In former times which saw war waged ceaselessly in Eorzea, the warriors featured prominently on the frontlines of battle. With the arrival of peacetime their art has descended into the shadows of obscurity - yet there are those few lucky Marauders who make enough of a name for themselves to be called to quell the raging beast inside.In battle, a Warrior can be seen as a berserker, falling further into a battle high while drawing the attention of enemies. It's said their rage can cause them to heal themselves as they hurt their opponents. Their attacks can break rocks in a single hit, and their axes swing effortlessly sweeping the field of enemies.

Clad in brilliant silver armor, they charge fearlessly into battle, ever ready to lay down their lives for their liege.To be a paladin is to protect, and those who choose to walk this path will become the iron foundation upon which the party's defense is built. Many of these Sultansworn begin their journeys as gladiators or fighting in the Brass Blades.

These two deities came to quarrel over which should rule the new world, and created mortals to serve in their war by proxy. These were the first Au Ra—the Raen, children of the Dawn Father, and the Xaela, the chosen of the Dusk Mother.Believing themselves the children of the Dawn Father, the forebears of the Auri Raen left behind their homeland to settle across Othard. They were received with hatred and hostility in the early years, until a prominent warlord of Yanxia, impressed with their valor, forged an alliance with the strange race and took them on as retainers.No matter where they came to be, with their innate martial prowess, they readily found employment as soldiers and carved out places for themselves within spheres of authority. Before long, the Raen had assumed a prominent role as warriors in service of countless great warlords, and their members spread across the Far East, from the lands of Nagxia and beyond the Ruby Sea to the isles of Hingashi, where they earned a reputation as legendary swordsmen.Among the peoples of the Far East, it is believed that the Au Ra of the Azim Steppe were the first to keep livestock. They initially tamed horses to serve as mounts, and it was this achievement which led to the Au Ra's decisive rise to dominance over the plains. When the Raen subsequently departed their ancestral home, they took with them the knowledge of rearing and riding horses to the lands beyond the Steppe. After the horse, the Au Ra turned their hand to taming the yol, and these new mounts saw them expand their dominion to the skies above the Steppe.The Xaela have to this day not abandoned their ancestral home, living a nomadic life as hunters and gatherers on the vast Azim Steppe. With suitable grazing land sparse, conflict between individual tribes is common, with tribes forming, disbanding, and dying off in a ceaseless cycle of war and bloodshed.Not all Xaela dwell upon the steppes, however. In 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, some among the Xaela who lived in frontier towns of Othard fell under subjugation of the Garlean Empire. When they arrived at last in Eorzea in the year 1562, they found themselves drawn to the plains of Coerthas, and hoped to adopt the nomadic ways of their ancestors, only to be massacred by the people of Ishgard.<img alt="Pasted image 20251126161223.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126161223.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>races/au-ra.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/Au Ra.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 23:12:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20251126161223]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20251126161223.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20251126161223.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20251126161223.png</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 23:12:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hrothgar]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hailing from Southern Ilsabard, the Helion clan once lived and served under a single ruler and made their home in Bozja. The Helion clan centered their society and daily lives around their queen, who was chosen by favor of the gods. The Hrothgar stuggled against the Allagan Empire in a futile war until the land was brought together under a single queen, who put an end to the war. This first queen was named Gunnhildr.Despite the city of Bozja being reborn, it still suffered from extreme poverty, allowing the Garlean Empire to invade and take control, causing many Hrothgar to flee to the distant shores of Eorzea. After the Bozja Incident many Hrothgar Helions had fled the country to seek lives elsewhere.Order is the guiding principle of Helion culture. With a queen at its center, the community obeys a strict code of conduct, with each member carrying out their assigned roles. A female child is instructed in her duties from birth and, one she comes of age, a segment of the population will break away to form a new community under this new queen. Under certain circumstances, the queen may welcome others from outsider her home clan, including the Lost.The Lost are a distinction of Hrothgar as identified by scholars in the same vein as Helions. However, for one reason or another, The Lost have found themselves bereft of their queen's presence. The techniques of the Gunbreaker are said to be inherited from the Hrothgar from Northern Ilsabard and passed down generations. Their weapons are what the Garlean Empire based theirs on after their invasion and eventual takeover.In contrast to the Helions' well-defined social order, the culture of the Lost is characterized by chaos. As many have lived their entire lives adhering to clear roles and strict laws, the sudden loss of structure must be disorienting at best. Many Lost fully embrace the nomadic lifestyle, committing themselves to the search for new purpose. This may mean exacting vengeance for a slain queen, or seeking to honor their late ruler by carrying out her final wishes. Each of the Lost, it is said, is lost in their own way.<img alt="Pasted image 20251126155220.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126155220.png" target="_self" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>

They are blessed with extremely keen eyesight and their fondness for law and order has contributed to a reputation for being haughty and argumentative. The clan is also known for its innovative genius, contributing greatly to the carpentry and leatherwork of Gridania.Among their Duskwight brethren, Wildwood Elezen are referred to as "Greens," for their love of the forest. The name "Wildwood" is typically used to refer to the forest-dwelling Elezen of Gridania, but those of Ishgard share the same common ancestry. As such, Gridania and Ishgard have traditionally enjoyed close relations, with each nation coming to the other's aid in times of need.Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and seclusion in the depths of Eorzea's caves and caverns. Today, they are called the Duskwight though to their Wildwood cousins they are known simply as the "Greys," after their preference for darkness and stone.These cave-dwelling Elezen are the descendants of a branch that split from the main Wildwood clan during the founding of Gridania, choosing instead to remain in the stone-hewn chambers of Gelmorra or seek out new subterranean sanctums. The Duskwight despise the "shackles" of urban life, and it is not uncommon for them to avoid the city-states altogether.Some even resort to brigandry to survive and, as a result, they are often looked upon with scorn by the citizens of Gridania. Those who have chosen to make their home in the city often suffer undue discrimination at the hands of their neighbors.<img alt="Pasted image 20251126154852.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126154852.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>races/elezen.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/Elezen.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:51:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20251126154852]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20251126154852.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20251126154852.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20251126154852.png</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:48:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lalafell]]></title><description><![CDATA[The flat landscapes of the Plainsfolk's home islands are dotted with the clan's traditional thatched huts, beneath which lie intricate networks of underground passageways. Their distinct hair coloration—a myriad of earthy and grassy tones—mimics their native environment, and their long, pointy ears are said to be able to detect the faintest scampering of the prairie's various fauna. Their skin tones tend generally toward the fairer, lighter side of the spectrum, though as with many races this is not universal.This inclination toward grasslands and plains naturally led the bulk of Eorzea's Plainsfolk to Vylbrand's wide meadows; it has been strongly implied that they made up a major portion, perhaps the majority, of the population of&nbsp;<a data-href="Nym" href="locations/eorzea/vylbrand/nym.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nym</a>, and even today the greater majority of Plainsfolk can be found in and around Limsa Lominsa.

While adverse to this encroachment on their independence, the city-state's pirates are willing to put aside their differences, lest the Garlean Empire take more than just their freedom.<img alt="Pasted image 20250306232855.png" src="images/pasted-image-20250306232855.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>organizations/maelstrom.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Organizations/Maelstrom.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:29:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20250306232855]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20250306232855.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20250306232855.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20250306232855.png</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:28:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20250306232750]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20250306232750.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20250306232750.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20250306232750.png</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:27:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Order of the Twin Adder]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Order of the Twin Adder establishes a medium from which the Seedseers can return from their wanderings deep within the&nbsp;Black Shroud&nbsp;and directly oversee not only the safety of <a data-href="Gridania" href="locations/eorzea/the-black-shroud/gridania.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gridania</a>'s citizens, but the workings of the local guard.
