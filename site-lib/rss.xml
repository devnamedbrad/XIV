The dragon Nidhogg attacked them, killing the king, but his son, Haldrath, took the wyrm's eye and forced him to retreat. In the wake of the king's demise, Haldrath refused the crown and became the first Azure Dragoon. The Elezen chose to put power in faith, annointing an archbishop as sovereign of their new nation with the remaining knights founding the four High Houses of Ishgard.Ishgard's banner displays the crests of the four High Houses on an escutcheon and the winged crown on top represents the archbishop. The city-state's motto, "Of the Sky, From the Sky, For the Sky", is featured beneath the sigils.

Who, then, defends the feeble from the transgressions of those meant to guide and protect them? A valiant few take up arms to defend the downtrodden, and not even the holy priests and knights can escape their judgment. Pariahs in their own land, they are known by many as “dark knights.” These sentinels bear no shields declaring their allegiance. Instead, their greatswords act as beacons to guide the meek through darkness.In battle, dark knights use forbidden magicks to infuse their blades with the powers of darkness to strike down their enemies and defend their allies. From debilitating entropy attacks to purple flamed sword swings. One is rumored as being able to summon a shadow clone to fight beside them.

A Thavnairian troupe has made it's way to Limsa Lominsa, taking on a new local apprentice.In battle, a Dancer will weave the magics that inspire, while effortlessly throwing their chakram around the field.

Few know, however, that bards in fact trace their origins back to the bowmen of eld, who sang in the heat of battle to fortify the spirits of their companions. In time, their impassioned songs came to hold sway over the hearts of men, inspiring their comrades to great feats and granting peace unto those who lay upon the precipice of death. The God's Quiver archers of Gridania have seen the arrival of new Bards, and the start of a new segment of their army.In battle, a Bard will distance themselves to shoot an enemy from afar while providing songs to boost the strength of their party. Skilled archers in their own right, some can shoot 3 arrows at once, soem laced with the poison of the fauna of Gridania. The songs of eld are being recreated by the desire to heal and strengthen as their previous soul stone owners did. <img alt="Pasted image 20251203121055.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251203121055.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d10, INS d8, WLP d8

That was, until they were driven from this paradise by invaders wielding arcane magicks. Forced north into the frigid mountains, the survivors sought a means to tap into the reservoir of aether otherwise closed to them. A daring few found their answer within the void, binding themselves to its creatures to gain verboten power─power fed by the souls of the slain. Once more they took up their scythes, this time to reap a crimson harvest.In Ul'dah, a small cabal of hidden Garlean defectors works to fight the voidsent in the area.In battle, a Reaper uses their connection to the void to rip their enemies with their scythe, and tear them down with the aid of their voidsent. Absorbing the strength of the fallen to empower their attacks, a reaper is a terrifying foe when a battle continues for too long. Old Garlean wives tales whisper of those who take the pact with their voidsent too far, allowing it to temporarily merge with them to unleash a new hell on their enemies. <img alt="Pasted image 20251202203923.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202203923.png" target="_self">MIG d10, DEX d6, INS d8, WLP d8

In the distant past, the realm's great lords vied for supremacy over its sea-girt confines in a long and bloody conflict. And taking to battle in their lieges' names were noble swordsmen whose art was forged in the crucible of war: the samurai.Eventually, the nation was unified under one banner, and these warriors came to wield their katana not upon fields as part of an army, but upon streets as protectors of the peace.But as a neglected blade grows dull with rust, so too do men forget their purpose. Amidst waning memories of the old ways, a determined few hold fast to their convictions, hands by katana grips, awaiting the moment for steel to sing.

Though pugilists command formidable power when unarmed, they are wont to use metal, leather, and bone weaponry to maximize their destructive potential.Though now under Garlean rule, the city-state of Ala Mhigo once boasted the greatest military might of all Eorzea. Among its standing armies were the monks—ascetic warriors as dreaded by foes on the field of battle as the city-state's great pikemen.The monks comprised an order known as the Fist of Rhalgr, and it was to this god—the Destroyer—that they devoted their lives of worship. By mastering seats of power within the body known as chakra, they are capable of performing extraordinary physical feats. Though many of these monks are long since passed, a promising pugilist has been asked to train under an Ala Mhigan master.In battle, a Monk is a close combat brawler who's attacks swap between different stances, but blend together into a dance of destruction. Through openign their chakras they buidl toward explosive attacks to stun enemies. Tales of old Ala Mhigo tell of Monks who could launch themselves into the sky to deliver devastating, crater causing kicks.<img alt="Pasted image 20251202194915.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202194915.png" target="_self">MIG d10, DEX d10, INS d6, WLP d6

Held within special grimoires, these symbols lend shape to the arcanist's aether, thereby allowing them to produce a myriad of powerful spells. Using magicked gemstones upon which the selfsame symbols are graven, arcanists are also able to summon forth the ephemeral being Carbuncle to carry out their bidding.In times immemorial, there lived mages who had not only the power to summon the primals, but also the means to transmute the primals' essences, thus binding them to their will. Known simply as summoners, the existence of these men and women and their arcane art have been all but lost to the ages. But with a rise in threats of primals, a young Miqote has sought the aid of a talented Arcanist to try to remake the Summoners. In battle, a Summoner (starting as an Arcanist) provides offensive support to their party by twisting aether into the forms of carbuncles, and gemshined magics. Though the idea of a Summoner today is nearly impossible, the threats of Primals make their study and growing strength a guarantee. <img alt="Pasted image 20251202193752.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202193752.png" target="_self"><img alt="Pasted image 20251202193733.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202193733.png" target="_self">MIG d6, DEX d6, INS d10, WLP d10

Among these, perhaps the most distinguished is an altruistic art which draws upon the wisdom of aetherology, sorcery, and medicine. Dubbed somanoutics, the art seeks to heal and protect by manipulating corporeal aether through the use of nouliths, a flying array of foci. Practitioners are dedicated to the betterment of mankind, and for their wisdom and compassion, eventually came to be known simply as sages. One such Sage has traveled to Eorzea to find a competent student to take the mantle. In battle, a Sage controls aether to change the battle. Using their nouliths to undo wounds,

Known as paladins, these men and women marry exquisite swordplay with stalwart shieldwork to create a style of combat uncompromising in its defense. Clad in brilliant silver armor, they charge fearlessly into battle, ever ready to lay down their lives for their liege.To be a paladin is to protect, and those who choose to walk this path will become the iron foundation upon which the party's defense is built. Many of these Sultansworn begin their journeys as gladiators or fighting in the Brass Blades. Yet beloved as they are as the shield of the sultanate, the Sultansworn have lost their former luster-both their morale and their numbers dwindling apace with the royal family's eroded authority.In battle, a Paladin acts as a bulwark to the enemies attacks. Using their large shields as a defense and their quick sword attacks to clear the front. Paladins call upon a holy light in their fights, sometimes to heal and in scrolls of eld, to summon blades of light to pierce their enemies, dubbed Requiescat.<img alt="Pasted image 20251202142816.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251202142816.png" target="_self">MIG d10, DEX d6, INS d8, WLP d8

These two deities came to quarrel over which should rule the new world, and created mortals to serve in their war by proxy. These were the first Au Ra—the Raen, children of the Dawn Father, and the Xaela, the chosen of the Dusk Mother.Believing themselves the children of the Dawn Father, the forebears of the Auri Raen left behind their homeland to settle across Othard. They were received with hatred and hostility in the early years, until a prominent warlord of Yanxia, impressed with their valor, forged an alliance with the strange race and took them on as retainers.No matter where they came to be, with their innate martial prowess, they readily found employment as soldiers and carved out places for themselves within spheres of authority. Before long, the Raen had assumed a prominent role as warriors in service of countless great warlords, and their members spread across the Far East, from the lands of Nagxia and beyond the Ruby Sea to the isles of Hingashi, where they earned a reputation as legendary swordsmen.Among the peoples of the Far East, it is believed that the Au Ra of the Azim Steppe were the first to keep livestock. They initially tamed horses to serve as mounts, and it was this achievement which led to the Au Ra's decisive rise to dominance over the plains. When the Raen subsequently departed their ancestral home, they took with them the knowledge of rearing and riding horses to the lands beyond the Steppe. After the horse, the Au Ra turned their hand to taming the yol, and these new mounts saw them expand their dominion to the skies above the Steppe.The Xaela have to this day not abandoned their ancestral home, living a nomadic life as hunters and gatherers on the vast Azim Steppe. With suitable grazing land sparse, conflict between individual tribes is common, with tribes forming, disbanding, and dying off in a ceaseless cycle of war and bloodshed.Not all Xaela dwell upon the steppes, however. In 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, some among the Xaela who lived in frontier towns of Othard fell under subjugation of the Garlean Empire. When they arrived at last in Eorzea in the year 1562, they found themselves drawn to the plains of Coerthas, and hoped to adopt the nomadic ways of their ancestors, only to be massacred by the people of Ishgard.<img alt="Pasted image 20251126161223.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126161223.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>races/au-ra.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/Au Ra.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 23:12:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20251126161223]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20251126161223.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20251126161223.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20251126161223.png</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 23:12:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hrothgar]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hailing from Southern Ilsabard, the Helion clan once lived and served under a single ruler and made their home in Bozja. The Helion clan centered their society and daily lives around their queen, who was chosen by favor of the gods. The Hrothgar stuggled against the Allagan Empire in a futile war until the land was brought together under a single queen, who put an end to the war. This first queen was named Gunnhildr.Despite the city of Bozja being reborn, it still suffered from extreme poverty, allowing the Garlean Empire to invade and take control, causing many Hrothgar to flee to the distant shores of Eorzea. After the Bozja Incident many Hrothgar Helions had fled the country to seek lives elsewhere.Order is the guiding principle of Helion culture. With a queen at its center, the community obeys a strict code of conduct, with each member carrying out their assigned roles. A female child is instructed in her duties from birth and, one she comes of age, a segment of the population will break away to form a new community under this new queen. Under certain circumstances, the queen may welcome others from outsider her home clan, including the Lost.The Lost are a distinction of Hrothgar as identified by scholars in the same vein as Helions. However, for one reason or another, The Lost have found themselves bereft of their queen's presence. The techniques of the Gunbreaker are said to be inherited from the Hrothgar from Northern Ilsabard and passed down generations. Their weapons are what the Garlean Empire based theirs on after their invasion and eventual takeover.In contrast to the Helions' well-defined social order, the culture of the Lost is characterized by chaos. As many have lived their entire lives adhering to clear roles and strict laws, the sudden loss of structure must be disorienting at best. Many Lost fully embrace the nomadic lifestyle, committing themselves to the search for new purpose. This may mean exacting vengeance for a slain queen, or seeking to honor their late ruler by carrying out her final wishes. Each of the Lost, it is said, is lost in their own way.<img alt="Pasted image 20251126155220.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126155220.png" target="_self" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>

They are blessed with extremely keen eyesight and their fondness for law and order has contributed to a reputation for being haughty and argumentative. The clan is also known for its innovative genius, contributing greatly to the carpentry and leatherwork of Gridania.Among their Duskwight brethren, Wildwood Elezen are referred to as "Greens," for their love of the forest. The name "Wildwood" is typically used to refer to the forest-dwelling Elezen of Gridania, but those of Ishgard share the same common ancestry. As such, Gridania and Ishgard have traditionally enjoyed close relations, with each nation coming to the other's aid in times of need.Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and seclusion in the depths of Eorzea's caves and caverns. Today, they are called the Duskwight though to their Wildwood cousins they are known simply as the "Greys," after their preference for darkness and stone.These cave-dwelling Elezen are the descendants of a branch that split from the main Wildwood clan during the founding of Gridania, choosing instead to remain in the stone-hewn chambers of Gelmorra or seek out new subterranean sanctums. The Duskwight despise the "shackles" of urban life, and it is not uncommon for them to avoid the city-states altogether.Some even resort to brigandry to survive and, as a result, they are often looked upon with scorn by the citizens of Gridania. Those who have chosen to make their home in the city often suffer undue discrimination at the hands of their neighbors.<img alt="Pasted image 20251126154852.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126154852.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>races/elezen.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/Elezen.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:51:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20251126154852]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20251126154852.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20251126154852.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20251126154852.png</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:48:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lalafell]]></title><description><![CDATA[The flat landscapes of the Plainsfolk's home islands are dotted with the clan's traditional thatched huts, beneath which lie intricate networks of underground passageways. Their distinct hair coloration—a myriad of earthy and grassy tones—mimics their native environment, and their long, pointy ears are said to be able to detect the faintest scampering of the prairie's various fauna. Their skin tones tend generally toward the fairer, lighter side of the spectrum, though as with many races this is not universal.This inclination toward grasslands and plains naturally led the bulk of Eorzea's Plainsfolk to Vylbrand's wide meadows; it has been strongly implied that they made up a major portion, perhaps the majority, of the population of&nbsp;<a data-href="Nym" href="locations/eorzea/vylbrand/nym.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nym</a>, and even today the greater majority of Plainsfolk can be found in and around Limsa Lominsa. They are somewhat more diasporized than the Dunesfolk, though, and some Plainsfolk can be found in nearly every corner of the land, from North Shroud to the southern tip of Thanalan, with quite a few to be found in Ul'dah. <br>Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Dunesfolk culture is its traditional dwellings—structures affixed to the backs of large beasts of burden. The luminous eyes of the Dunesfolk are the result of a glossy, protective layer which covers the pupil, an evolutionary response to the glaring sunlight of their home region. Many individuals wear a small gemstone on their forehead, representing their&nbsp;zodiacal sign. Dunesfolk have a particularly wide variation in skin tone - while many tend toward the darker side of the spectrum (as they live in a desert), several Dunesfolk, such as&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo" data-href="Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo" href="people/ul'dah/sultana-nanamo-ul-namo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nanamo Ul Namo</a>, are among the fairest-skinned individuals in Eorzea.While the traditional dwelling of the Dunesfolk is on beasts of burden, the Dunesfolk are also the founders of the city of Ul'dah. The vast majority of Dunesfolk a traveler encounters in modern Eorzea will be from that city - if you encounter a Dunefolk on the bridge-streets of Limsa or angrily haggling for a chocobo outside of Gridania, odds are they'll be from Ul'dah. Ul'dah's prosperity means that very few Dunesfolk have settled away from the city-state.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20251126153758.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126153758.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>races/lalafell.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/Lalafell.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:48:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Viera]]></title><description><![CDATA[The&nbsp;Rava&nbsp;clan are native to the&nbsp;Golmore Jungle and live as a hunter-gatherer society.

Though the neighboring kingdom of Dalmasca has tried time and again to subjugate them, the Rava have always resisted or even retaliated with violence and have maintained a self-governing dominion. Due to their strict adherence to the Green Word, Most Viera have had little to no interaction with the outside world, with very few willing to suffer exile. However, in more recent times, the Viera can be seen living in outside cities and are often held in high regard and seen as "mysterious".The&nbsp;Veena&nbsp;clan are native to the forests at the foothills of the&nbsp;<a data-href="Skatay Range" href="locations/skatay-range.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Skatay Range</a> and live as a hunter-gatherer society.

After the Garlean Empire took over Dalmasca and divided the land into two regions, even though the forces of the Empire were stronger, they had a very difficult time taking the whole of Nagxia, as the smaller groups used the forests around the Skatay Range to their advantage. While the Veena turned people away, they did still take some in and offer them refuge. However, in recent times, the fires of war have led to some of the Veena breaking the Green Word and leaving their ancestral homeland for the cities of Eorzea.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20251126154655.png" src="images/pasted-image-20251126154655.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>races/viera.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/Viera.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:46:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20251126154655]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20251126154655.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20251126154655.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20251126154655.png</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:46:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miqote]]></title><description><![CDATA[The nocturnal among the&nbsp;Miqo'te have dubbed themselves the&nbsp;Keepers of the Moon.

The Maelstrom is an extension of the First Squadron, expanding its role as armada flagship and granting it power to administer not only the remaining four squadrons, but the various merchant fleets that navigate the seas off Vylbrand. With the reestablishment of the Maelstrom, the Admiral has invoked ancient maritime law, by which she promoted herself to Chief Admiral, effectively expanding her authority to cover not only state and military dealings, but grant her the power to directly command all ships in Lominsan waters. While adverse to this encroachment on their independence, the city-state's pirates are willing to put aside their differences, lest the Garlean Empire take more than just their freedom.<img alt="Pasted image 20250306232855.png" src="images/pasted-image-20250306232855.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>organizations/maelstrom.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Organizations/Maelstrom.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:29:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20250306232855]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20250306232855.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20250306232855.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20250306232855.png</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:28:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20250306232750]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/pasted-image-20250306232750.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/pasted-image-20250306232750.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Images/Pasted image 20250306232750.png</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:27:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Order of the Twin Adder]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Order of the Twin Adder establishes a medium from which the Seedseers can return from their wanderings deep within the&nbsp;Black Shroud&nbsp;and directly oversee not only the safety of <a data-href="Gridania" href="locations/eorzea/the-black-shroud/gridania.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gridania</a>'s citizens, but the workings of the local guard.
